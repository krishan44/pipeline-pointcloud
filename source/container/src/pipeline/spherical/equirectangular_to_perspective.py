EQUIRECTANGULAR TO PERSPECTIVE IMAGE SEQUENCE OPTIMIZER
AUTHOR: ERIC CORNWELL

This script transforms equirectangular (360°) images into optimized perspective image sequences
for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. The algorithm addresses the challenge of creating
spatially and temporally consistent image sequences from spherical imagery.

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
==================

1. EQUIRECTANGULAR TO CUBEMAP CONVERSION:
   - Converts each ERP image to 6 cubemap faces (front, back, left, right, up, down)
   - Applies optional face filtering to remove unwanted views
   - Reconstructs filtered ERP images from modified cubemaps

2. CONNECTIVE IMAGE GENERATION:
   - Generates perspective images at multiple horizontal angles (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°)
   - Generates perspective images at multiple vertical angles (0° to 135°)
   - Creates images for key frames: start (0%), middle (50%), end (100%)
   - Creates additional frames at multiple insertion distances: 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%

3. VIEW-BASED SEQUENCE ORGANIZATION:
   - Reorganizes images by cubemap face rather than temporal sequence
   - Creates separate directories for each view: left, front, right, back, up, down
   - Optimizes view order for sequential SfM matching

4. VIEW NODE INSERTION (SPATIAL CONSISTENCY):
   Each view gets multiple "node images" inserted at specific positions to improve spatial continuity:
   
   - LEFT VIEW (multiple insertions at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%):
     * Uses frames at respective positions as sources
     * Inserts 16 perspective images per position (4 angles × 4 perspectives)
     * Perspectives: 04→03→02→01 (reverse order)
   
   - BACK VIEW (multiple insertions at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%):
     * Uses frames at respective positions as sources
     * Reverses file order first, then adjusts insertions to 90%, 70%, 50%, 30% of reversed sequence
     * Inserts 16 perspective images per position (4 angles × 4 perspectives)
     * Perspectives: 04→01→02→03
   
   - RIGHT VIEW (multiple insertions at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%):
     * Uses frames at respective positions as sources
     * Inserts 16 perspective images per position (4 angles × 4 perspectives) 
     * Perspectives: 02→01→04→03 (reverse angle order)
   
   - FRONT VIEW (multiple insertions at 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%):
     * Uses frames at respective positions as sources
     * Reverses file order first, then adjusts insertions to 70%, 50%, 30%, 10% of reversed sequence
     * Inserts 16 perspective images per position (4 angles × 4 perspectives)
     * Perspectives: 02→03→04→01
   
   - UP/DOWN VIEWS:
     * UP: Rotates images 90°, adds vertical connective images
       - With angled_up_views option: Adds additional 360° rotation with camera angled up (75° and 90°)
     * DOWN: Rotates images -90°, reverses order after processing
       - With angled_down_views option: Adds additional 360° rotation with camera angled down (15° and 30°)

5. CONNECTIVE IMAGE INSERTION:
   - Adds transition images between views to improve feature matching
   - Uses images from temporally adjacent frames (first/last)
   - Appends to end of each view sequence

6. FINAL SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY:
   - Reorders views: Left→Front→Right→Back→Up→Down
   - Renumbers all images sequentially (00001, 00002, etc.)
   - Creates final optimized sequence for SfM processing

SPATIAL CONSISTENCY PRINCIPLE:
=============================
The algorithm ensures that view nodes use source images from frames that correspond
to their insertion position in the temporal sequence. This maintains spatial coherence
by using multiple insertion points across the sequence:

- LEFT VIEW: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% insertions use corresponding frame sources
- BACK VIEW: 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% insertions use corresponding frame sources
- RIGHT VIEW: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% insertions use corresponding frame sources
- FRONT VIEW: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% insertions use corresponding frame sources

This multi-node approach significantly improves SfM convergence by providing dense,
spatially consistent feature correspondences across the optimized image sequence.

This approach significantly improves SfM convergence by providing spatially consistent
feature correspondences across the optimized image sequence.
